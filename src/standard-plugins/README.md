# DTile standard plugins
Theses plugins are intended to be included in DTile by default but will also
have an option to be turned off. Plugins are meant to provide non-standard
features that wouldn't neccessarily fit into the core experience of DTile which
is supposed to be as streamlined as possible. What can be accomplished with
plugins is almost endless since they have access to the entire DOM and all of
its features. As they say though, *with great power comes great responsibility*.

## These may move
It's likely that these plugins will get their separate repository, but for now,
they are included in the main DTile repository to speed up initial development.
