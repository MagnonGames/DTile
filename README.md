DTile aims to be the best tilemap editor available today. It's made with Three.js, Polymer and ES2015, meaning it has a lot of potential, but is currently kind of slow and only runs on recent browsers (read: essentially only latest stable Chrome).

## Why another tilemap editor? Isn't Tiled enough?
Tiled is a great program with a lot of features and we're absolutely not saying that you can't create great games with it. However, where it's lacking is in terms of ease-of-use. Tiled has a lot of features which makes it capable of doing a lot of things such as different types of maps and a lot of other things, but that takes a pretty huge hit on usability. What DTile aims to do is to strip out all of the unnecessary features and provide you with a great out-of-the-box experience while still allowing for expandability with plugins (again, coming... Well, later).

## Using DTile
DTile is NOT ready for production in any kind of way at all. It's currently very much in development and the master branch can not be considered stable. If you're not planning on contributing to DTile then you should probably wait a while until we're done with a relatively stable version at least.
