DTile aims to be the best tilemap editor available today. It runs in your browser
(right now only Chrome) and has the ability to adapt to what you need it to do.
If you're making a complete game with it, you can make your own custom game
plugin that allows you to have all the options you need right at your fingertips
or if you just want to show off a cool tileset you made, DTile is already
configured with all the essentials out of the box.

## DTile is in Alpha
DTile is using some of the latest cutting edge features of the web-platform
and therefore is only functional in Chrome right now. It's also not really
super stable, though you can certainly play around with it or even use it for a
game if your feeling daring.

## Contributing
We want to make contributing to DTile as easy and frictionless as possible. If
you want to help out, but you have something you're unsure about, send an email
to [dtile@magnon.net]() and someone (most likely @magnonellie) will help you
out! We don't bite and you can help out no matter what your skillset is. You
don't have to be able to code to make a good contribution!

If you want to add a new feature, a good idea is to open an issue first before
starting to write code to see if others may have valuable feedback.

## License
MIT - Basically you can do whatever you want with it as long as you credit us
for making it originally. That said, we always appreciate seeing what you have
made and we're absolutely not against merging good changes.
